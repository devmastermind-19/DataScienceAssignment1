NYC Congestion Pricing Audit — 2025

Big Data Engineering & Analytics Pipeline

Overview

This project presents a full-scale **Big Data engineering and analytics audit** of the 2025 **Manhattan Congestion Relief Zone Toll**, designed to evaluate its impact on traffic flow, revenue generation, economic fairness, and system integrity. Using NYC TLC taxi trip data, a modular and reproducible pipeline was developed to automate data ingestion, perform large-scale processing with Dask, detect anomalous “ghost trips,” conduct geospatial and economic analysis, and generate interactive dashboards. The analysis estimates **$81.9M in total surcharge revenue**, reveals largely **inelastic demand during rainfall**, and identifies **1.28M+ suspicious trips**, leading to data-backed policy recommendations focused on real-time fraud prevention and system optimization.
